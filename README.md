# Mautic Plugin Boilerplate

Empty Mautic plugin bundle (zero functionality). Tested on **Mautic 4**. Go ahead use this boilerplate and provide more custom functionality to Mautic - Open source Marketing Automation Tool.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Composer 2
* Mautic 4

### Installing

**Initial install** described below.

```
cd <mautic-root-folder>
rm -rf var/cache/dev/* var/cache/prod/*
cd plugins
git clone <repo-url> HelloWorldBundle
cd <mautic-root-folder>
composer install  # You only need this druing development.
php bin/console mautic:plugins:install --dev  # You should get a message saying one or more plugins have been installed in terminal.
```

Typical **update** of plugin source code described below.

* Make sure plugin root folder is clean from gitÂ´s point of view.

```
cd <mautic-root-folder>
rm -rf var/cache/dev/* var/cache/prod/*
cd plugins/HelloWorldBundle
git pull origin <branch>
php bin/console mautic:plugins:reload --dev  # You should get a message saying one or more plugins have been installed in terminal.
```

### Creating new plugin from this template

From Mautic core composer.json remove usage of command (as it deletes the git directories and its useful not what you want):

```
@remove-git-submodules
```

```
git clone <repo-url> <plugin-name>
./bin/manage.sh plugin:init:env  Defines plugin namespace
./bin/manage.sh dev:hooks  # Installs git hooks
./bin/manage.sh plugin:change:namespace  # Will work only once.
```
